From e-mail with meyering@na-net.ornl.gov:

    [...] Stow is designed to be paranoid about modifying anything it
    doesn't "own."  If it finds a symlink in the target tree (e.g.,
    /usr/local/info) which doesn't point into the stow tree, its
    paranoid response is to leave it the hell alone.  But I can see in
    this case how traversing the link and populating the directory on
    the far end would be OK.  Question: is that a special
    circumstance, or would it always be OK to populate the far end of
    a symlink in the target tree (when the symlink points to a
    directory in a context where a directory is needed)?  And: if it's
    a special circumstance requiring a command-line option, should the
    option be a mere boolean (such as, "--traverse-target-links") or
    should it be an enumeration of which links are OK to traverse
    (such as, "--traversable='info man doc'")?

Does Version 2 fix this? (Kal)
I think that because it never needs to create /usr/local/info,
it only needs to check the ownership of links that it _operates_ on,
not on all the elements of the path.
