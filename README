This is GNU Stow, a program for managing the installation of software
packages, keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs.
/usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while making them appear to be installed in
the same place (/usr/local).  Stow doesn't store an extra state between runs,
so there's no danger of mangling directories when file hierarchies don't match
the database. Also, stow will never delete any files, directories, or links
that appear in a stow directory, so it is always possible to rebuild the
target tree.

Stow is a Perl script which should run correctly under Perl 5.6.1 or
newer.  You must install Perl before running Stow.  For more
information about Perl, see http://www.perl.com/perl/.

Stow was inspired by Carnegie Mellon's "Depot" program, but is substantially
simpler.  Whereas Depot requires database files to keep things in sync, Stow
stores no extra state between runs, so there's no danger (as there is in
Depot) of mangling directories when file hierarchies don't match the database.
Also unlike Depot, Stow will never delete any files, directories, or links
that appear in a Stow directory (e.g., /usr/local/stow/emacs), so it's always
possible to rebuild the target tree (e.g., /usr/local).

Stow is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License, which
can be found in the file COPYING.
