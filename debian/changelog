Old Changelog:
stow (1.3.2-10) frozen unstable; urgency=medium, closes=24093

  * Three-line patch to prevent stow -D / stow -R from removing
    initially-empty directories from the target tree.  We make stow
    consider an empty directory not to be "pure", so it doesn't try
    coalescing.  This should be safe to install into hamm, since it does
    nothing but turn off an optimisation under certain circumstances.
    (Fixes Bug#24093: stow -D deletes unrelated empty directories.)
