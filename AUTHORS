Stow was written by Bob Glickstein <bobg+stow@zanshin.com>, Zanshin
Software, Inc.

Contributions from Gord Matzigkeit <gord@enci.ucalgary.ca>.

John Bazik wrote `fastcwd', the Perl subroutine for computing the
current working directory.

Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpbs@debian.org> wrote the fix to prevent 
stow -D / stow -R removing initially-empty directories.

Adam Lackorzynski <al10@inf.tu-dresden.de> wrote the fix to prevente
the generation of wrong links if there are links in the stow directory.

Stow was maintained by Guillaume Morin <gmorin@gnu.org> up to November 2007.

Kahlil (Kal) Hodgson <kahlil@internode.on.net> performed a major rewrite
inorder to implement:

    1. defered operations,
    2. option parsing via Getopt::Long,
    3. options to support shared files, 
    4. support for multiple operations per invocation,
    5. default command line arguments via '.stowrc' and '~/.stowrc' files, 
    6. better cooperation between multiple stow directories,
    7. a test suite (and support code) to ensure that everything still works.  

As these changes required a dramatic reorganisation of the code, very little
was left untouched, and so Stow's major version was bumped up to version 2.

Austin Wood <austin.wood@rmit.edu.au> and Chris Hoobin
<christopher.hoobin@rmit.edu.au> helped clean up the documentation for 
version 2 and created the texi2man script.

Stow is currently maintained by Kahlil (Kal) Hodgson <kahlil@internode.on.net>.
